Things we need to do:

PARAMETER INTIALIZATION:

Speed Initialization - Function that does tests and collects speed data and models it
	- Moves at different speeds and directions
	- Models most likely done in MATLAB and then sent back to Arduino
	- Writes information to a text file (can only be done in MATLAB)

Motor direction intialization - Function that tells you which switches correspond to which directions
	- Writes it to a text file

EXPERIMENT DESIGN:

Arc movement - Will be able to designate distance from between the monkey's eyes to target, intial and final locations in degrees, and speed
	- Circular movement in Arduino

Talk to Divya about syncing up our code with data collection systems

In the end will need to be able to do 4 types of experiments
	- Smooth pursuit while keeping vergence angle constant
	- Linear smooth pursuit vergence movements centered on one eye or between the two eyes
	- Saccade from back screen to target in space
	- Linear smooth pursuit while altering vergence angle

RIG IMPROVEMENTS:

Increase gear size to increase speed
	- Needs to be able to move at 130 degrees per second
	- Max range needs to be a bit larger than working range
	- May need to upgrade motors for corresponding increases in torque
